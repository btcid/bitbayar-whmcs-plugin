# Usage
When a client chooses the BitBayar payment method, they will be presented with an invoice showing a button they will have to click on in order to pay their order. Upon requesting to pay their order, the system takes the client to a full-screen bitbayar.com invoice page where the client is presented with payment instructions. Once payment is received, a link is presented to the shopper that will return them to your website.

**NOTE:** Don't worry! a payment will automatically update your WHMCS store whether or not the customer returns to your website after they've paid the invoice.

In your WHMCS control panel, you can see the information associated with each order made via BitBayar by choosing **Orders > Pending Orders**. This screen will tell you whether payment has been received by the BitBayar servers. You can also view the details for any paid invoice inside your BitBayar merchant dashboard under the **Payments** page.
